# 💻 C Programs Collection

This folder contains a variety of C programs written for learning, practice, and reference purposes. Each program demonstrates a different concept or solves a specific problem using the C programming language.

## 📁 What's Inside

The programs are organized by topic or purpose and cover a wide range of concepts, such as:

- Basic I/O and syntax
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays, strings, and pointers
- Structures and unions
- File handling
- Algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching)
- Problem-solving and logic building

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any C file:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
````

Or with `clang`:

```bash
clang filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
```

Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang).

## 📌 Naming Convention

Each file is named based on its functionality or topic for easier identification.
Example:

* `fibonacci.c` – prints Fibonacci series
* `bubble_sort.c` – performs bubble sort
